When we render a Flavor.jsx component (A page that retrieves all of the flavors associated with a specific category) by clicking the category in the Flavors dropdown in the navbar, there are two approaches.

We can either use the NavDropdown.Item anchor tag in the React Bootstrap library to navigate to the page, causing the page to refresh

OR 

We can use the NavDropdown.Item tag and use the 'as' props and set it to the Link component 

i.e
<NavDropdown.Item  as={Link} to="/categories">    

This prevents the page from refreshing and is a better approach for performance as it only rerenders that specific component and not the entire page. The problem is that 

1. The heading (i.e All Meat Flavors) changes before the data changes due to the async function, so it very briefly displays the wrong data 

Fixed: setFlavors(null) when Flavors.jsx is rendered
Implement: Spinning circle to indicate data is being fetched. While flavors is null, conditionally render the circle.

2. Affects the CLS in mobile versions causing the Quote form to jump up and down the screen.

Fixed: Set min height of categoryFlavors to 100vh instead of setting min height of categoryContainer to 100vh.
