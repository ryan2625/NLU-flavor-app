A Responsive 'Flavor' Website

Stack: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.

This website dynamically displays different flavors based on their category. The app is built using the MERN stack and stores a user's email information in the database, along with a list of flavor and category objects. This app also allows users to create reviews on the 'reviews' page. This app was mostly developed in 3 days for the NLU (National Louis University) coding challenge, with updates made afterward.

The app is accessible and employs several optimization techniques with the help of Lighthouse such as using modern image formats like .avif, prefetching content, using a global context to prevent redundant API calls, and caching CSS styles.

This project is hosted on the 'individual' plan offered by Render.com. This plan provides approximately 512 MB of RAM and 0.1 CPU, which may lead to occasional suboptimal performance. (Update: Now hosted on cyclic.sh for improved performance).
