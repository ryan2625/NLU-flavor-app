# flavor-app
A Responsive'flavor' website

Stack: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.

  A website that dynamically displays different flavors based on
their category. This app is built using the MERN stack and 
holds both a user's email info in the database as well as a list 
of flavor and category objects. This app was created largely over
the course of 3 days for NLU's (National Louis University) coding 
challenge with a few small updates after this time.

  This branch holds the changes that corrected the paths to host the server and client on Render.com
